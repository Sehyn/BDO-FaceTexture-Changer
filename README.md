# BDO-FaceTexture-Changer
Simple Face Texture 'patcher/changer' no need to do it manually for 24 characters with preset textures for all the classes (Pre-Awake, Awaken, Succession)
* https:/bdotools.net (soon)

**Planned to do a all in one tool to: replace fonts, replace face textures, graphics tweaks and more as long as it doesn't break the TOS.**

## To do :

- [ ] Add check box to have confirmation message when copied succesfully
- [ ] Clean code 
- [ ] Use a modern UI with a free and legal framework

## Made by :
* Sehyn

## Credits : 
* Reddit (u/wynn_kaurus for the preset textures)
* Stackoverflow community (https://stackoverflow.com)




## Information :
* Thank you for checking here!
* I'am an hobbyist developer not a professional one.
* My code is messy as hell, feel free to make modifications to it.
